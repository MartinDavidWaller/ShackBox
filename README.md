# To build and install this software you will need to:
#
# 1) Install the Ardiuno Interactive Development Environment. This
# can be found here:
#
#	https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
#
# Once installed you will need to install the following libraries.
#
#   -> Adafruit BMP085 Library by Adafruit 1.0.0
#
#   This can be done from the Sketch | Include Library | Manage Libraries...
#   menu option.
#
#   -> Library for the LiquidCrystal LCD display connected to an Arduino board
#
#   This can be downloaded from here:
# 
#     https://github.com/fdebrabander/Arduino-LiquidCrystal-I2C-library
#
#   The link also provides installation instructions.
#
#   -> Efficient alternative to SoftwareSerial with attachInterrupt for RX chars, simultaneous RX & TX
#
#   This can be downloaded from here:
#
#     https://github.com/SlashDevin/NeoSWSerial
#
#   It can be installed in a similar fashion to the LCD library
#
# 2) Connect the Arduino to your PC using the correct cable.
# 3) On the Tools | Board menu option select "Arduino Nano" 
# 4) On the Tools | Port menu option select the correct COM port
#    for the connected device.
# 5) Select the Sketch | Upload menu option. This should compile
#    the code and upload it to the Arduino Nano. 
#
# At this point your software is installed. This the circuit is
# complete and correctly built then you should see data on the
# display.
